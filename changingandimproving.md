# Changing and Improving

People who are effective in this area take initiative, are innovative and seek out opportunities to create effective change. For all staff, it’s about learning from what has worked as well as what has not, being open to change and improvement, and working in ‘smarter’, more focused ways. For leaders, this is about creating and encouraging a culture of innovation and allowing people to consider and take informed decisions. Doing this well means continuously seeking out ways to improve policy implementation and build a leaner, more flexible and responsive Civil Service. It also means making use of alternative delivery models including digital and shared service approaches wherever possible. 

### At Grade 6/7 you should demonstrate the following: 

- Understand and identify the role of technology in public service delivery and policy implementation
- Encourage and recognise a culture of initiative and innovation focused on adding value – give people space and praise for creativity
- Effectively capture, utilise and share customer insight and views from a diverse range of stakeholders to ensure better policy and delivery
- Spot warning signs of things going wrong and provide a decisive response to significant delivery challenges
- Provide constructive challenge to senior management on change proposals which will affect own business area
- Consider the cumulative impact on own business area of implementing change (culture, structure, service and morale)


### At this level you should not: 

- Overlook potential learning from what has worked and what hasn't
- Take a narrow and risk averse approach to proposed new approaches by not taking or following up on ideas seriously
- Fail to effectively capture, utilise and share customer insight appropriately in the development of policies and services
- Remain wedded to the course that they have set and unresponsive to the changing demands of the situation
- Spend limited time on engaging experts and relevant individuals in developing and testing proposals, failing to
- pass on relevant staff feedback
- Give limited time to acknowledging anxieties and overcoming cynicism
