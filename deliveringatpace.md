#  Delivering at Pace

Effectiveness in this area means focusing on delivering timely performance with energy and taking responsibility and accountability for quality outcomes. For all staff, it’s about working to agreed goals and activities and dealing with challenges in a responsive and constructive way. For leaders, it is about building a performance culture where staff are given the space, authority and support to deliver outcomes. It’s also about keeping a firm focus on priorities and addressing performance issues resolutely, fairly and promptly. 

### At Grade 6/7 you should demonstrate the following: 

- Set, maintain and ensure a clear direction for the Department, with highly focused priorities and project outcomes
- Retain accountability for achieving strategic priorities and outcomes
- Swiftly re-focus the Department on new priorities as changing situations dictate
- Drive a performance culture across the Department giving teams space and authority to deliver objectives whilst, resolutely holding them accountable for outcomes
- Encourage, support and coach individuals and teams across the Department to energise delivery
- Enable the organisation to remain focussed on core priorities irrespective of external challenges

### At this level you should not: 

- Display imprecision and lack of purpose about direction and focus of the Department
- Allow the Department’s focus to drift away from critical priorities and do not measure performance against them
- Stick to strategy even when it is superseded by events which necessitate a change
- Allow the Department to get away with poor results and inaction
- Expect people to perform with enthusiasm without giving support and encouragement
- Readily allow problems or external challenges to distract the Department from its core priorities
