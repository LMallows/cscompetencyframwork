#  Managing a Quality Service

Effectiveness in this area is about valuing and modelling professional excellence and expertise to deliver service objectives, taking account of diverse customer needs and requirements. People who are effective plan, organise and manage their time and activities to deliver a high quality and efficient service, applying programme and project and risk management approaches to support service delivery. For leaders, it is about creating an environment to deliver operational excellence and creating the most appropriate and cost effective delivery models for public services. 

### At Grade 6/7 you should demonstrate the following: 

- Exemplify positive customer service behaviours and promote a culture focused on ensuring customer needs are met 
- Establish how the business area compares to customer service expectations and industry best practice and identify necessary improvements in plans 
- Make clear, pragmatic and manageable plans for service delivery using programme and project management disciplines 
- Create regular opportunities for staff and customers to help improve service quality and demonstrate a visible involvement 
- Ensure the service offer thoroughly considers customers’ needs and a broad range of available methods to meet this, including new technology where relevant
- Ensure adherence to legal, regulatory and security requirements in service delivery and build diversity and equality considerations into plans

### At this level you should not: 

- Take little action when customer needs are not being met 
- Ignore external trends that impact on the business area 
- Allow programmes or service delivery to lose momentum and focus and have no contingencies in place 
- Make changes to service delivery with minimal involvement from others 
- Maintain a limited or out-dated view of how to respond to customers’ needs
- Disregard non–compliance with policies, rules and legal requirements and allow unfair or discriminatory practices
