# Building Capability for All

Effectiveness in this area is having a strong focus on continuous learning for oneself, others and the organisation. For all staff, it’s being open to learning, about keeping one’s own knowledge and skill set current and evolving. For leaders, it’s about investing in the capabilities of our people, to be effective now and in the future as well as giving clear, honest feedback and supporting teams to succeed. It’s also about creating a learning and knowledge culture across the organisation to inform future plans and transformational change. 

### At Grade 6/7 you should demonstrate the following: 

- Ensure that individual and organisational learning and talent development opportunities are fully exploited in order to enhance organisational capability 
- Role model work-place based learning and encourage development, talent and career management for all staff 
- Coach and support colleagues to take responsibility for their own development (through giving accountability, varied assignments and on-going feedback) 
- Establish and drive intra and inter team discussions to learn from experience and adapt organisational processes and plans
- Identify capability requirements needed to deliver future team objectives and support teams to succeed in delivering to meet those needs
- Prioritise and role model continuous self learning and development, including leadership, management and people skills 

### At this level you should not: 

- Ignore emerging learning and development opportunities and the sharing of that learning to benefit the organisation
- Not follow up on learning to ensure colleagues practise and apply new learning to the benefit of the organisation 
- Make token efforts to coach and develop people, allow staff to de-prioritise own development 
- Stay ignorant of the experience of colleagues and take little notice of the potential learning available
- Allow team capability needs to go unaddressed and fail to use development opportunities and effective performance management to maximise team capability
- Place low priority on people management and development, seldom seek feedback or challenge, and prioritise professional expertise over leadership, management and people skills
