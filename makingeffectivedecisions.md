# Seeing the Big Picture

Effectiveness in this area is about using sound judgement, evidence and knowledge to arrive at accurate, expert and professional decisions and advice. For all staff it’s being careful and thoughtful about the use and protection of government and public information to ensure it is handled securely and with care. For leaders it’s about reaching evidence based strategies, evaluating options, impacts, risks and solutions and creating a security culture around the handling information. They will aim to maximise return while minimising risk and balancing a range of considerations to provide sustainable outcomes

### At Grade 6/7 you should demonstrate the following: 

- Push decision making to the right level within their teams, not allow unnecessary bureaucracy and structure to suppress innovation and delivery 
- Ensure the secure and careful use of all government and public data and information within their area of activity and Department 
- Analyse and evaluate data from various sources to identify pros and cons and identify risks in order to make well considered decisions. 
- Draw together and present reasonable conclusions from a wide range of incomplete and complex evidence and data – able to act or decide even when details are not clear 
- Identify the main issues in complex problems, clarify understanding or stakeholder expectations, to seek best option
- Make difficult decisions by pragmatically weighing the complexities involved against the need to act

### At this level you should not: 

- Involve only those in their peer group or direct reporting line in decision making
- Give insufficient consideration to the impacts, constraints and opportunities when evaluating legal, security or HR concerns
- Take decisions without regard for the context, organisation risk, alignment with wider agendas or impacts (economic, social and environmental) 
- Get confused by complexity and ambiguity and consider only simple or straightforward evidence
- Rely too heavily on gut instinct and provide unclear, incoherent or illogical analysis of core issues 
- Make expedient decisions that offer less resistance or risk to themselves rather than decisions that are best for the business#
